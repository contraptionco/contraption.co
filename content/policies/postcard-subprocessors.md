# Postcard subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Postcard. We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending GDPR safeguards everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States:

* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/). Cloud services provider.
* [Render Services](https://render.com/privacy). Cloud services provider.
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/privacy). Payment processing services.
* [Postmark](https://wildbit.com/privacy-policy). Transactional email service.
* [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/privacy). Analytics provider.
