## What we collect, where we store it, and how long we keep it

When you apply for a job at Contraption Co. (the company), we may store your data in our [company data processors](/policies/company-processors). If you progress to later selection stages, your information may be colocated in Contraption Co. Services. Candidate data we collect and process are used for selection purposes only. Access to your personal information is limited to Contraption Co. employees who participate in the selection process.

We collect and store these data because we have a legitimate interest: we are trying to hire for a position and we need information from any candidate who applies for the role. If you apply for a job at Contraption Co., we ask for your explicit consent so that we can accept your application information, transfer it to the US, and review your candidacy.

For more information about your rights to your data, please view our general [privacy policy](/policies/privacy); all the rights outlined there also apply to your data as a candidate.

We keep records in Contraption Co. Services for some applicants, only those who progress to later selection rounds, and Contraption Co. records consist of:

* Your job application materials (full name, e-mail address, your answers to any short answer questions required in the application, your cover letter, your CV/resume);
* Internal assessment notes about your application and interviews;
* Reference contact information and notes on the results of reference checks.

For most candidates, we'll store your data in  until we successfully fill the open position. We'll keep your personal data for _up to two years_ if you advance to a take-home exercise or interview stage of our hiring process. We do this to maintain a pool of recent, qualified applicants, should the position re-open or should we decide to hire for another similar role. You can ask us to access, correct, update, or delete your data at any time by emailing [hello@contraption.co](mailto:hello@contraption.co).


If you have questions about your personal data as a job applicant, you can contact:
